# Weather Dashboard

A simple web application that displays the local weather based on the user's IP address location. The application uses [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) to determine the user's location and [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch weather data.

## Features

- Automatic location detection using IP geolocation
- Current weather display including:
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Feels like temperature
  - Weather condition with icon
  - Wind speed and direction
  - Humidity
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Loading and error states

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 15
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios for API requests
- Zod for data validation
- Lucide React for icons

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- WeatherAPI.com API key (sign up for free at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/))
